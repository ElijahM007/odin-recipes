# odin-recipes
I demonstrated my skills in basic html website building by making a recipes page that included three different recipes. Each recipe page included a heading that stated the name of the recipe, an image of the finished recipe, a heading for ingredients followed by an unordered list of ingredients, and a heading for steps followed by an order list of steps to make the recipe. The most challenging part of this project was downloading the images and moving/renaming them to the images folder.
